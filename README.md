# Url_Hit_Counter
 

This project is a Spring Boot application that provides functionality to track the number of times a user hits a specific URL. It exposes a RESTful API endpoint to retrieve the hit count for a given username.

# Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure that you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
Apache Maven installed
Spring Boot framework
# Getting Started
To run the URL Hit Counter application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
Build the project using the following command:
Copy code
mvn clean install
Once the build is successful, run the application using the following command:
arduino

mvn spring-boot:run
The application will start running on http://localhost:8080.
# API Endpoint
The URL Hit Counter application exposes the following API endpoint:

GET /api/v1/Url-Hit-Count/username/{username}/count: This endpoint retrieves the hit count for a specific username. Replace {username} in the URL with the desired username. For example, to get the hit count for user "Abhishek," make a GET request to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/Url-Hit-Count/username/{your_user_name}/count.
# Usage
To track the hit count for a specific URL, follow these steps:

Make a GET request to the API endpoint mentioned above, providing the desired username in the URL.
The application will process the request and return the hit count for that username.
You can repeat the GET request multiple times to observe the hit count increasing each time the URL is hit.
Customization
If you want to customize the application or integrate it into an existing project, consider the following:

Modify the data storage mechanism (e.g., database, in-memory cache) in the Url_service class to suit your requirements.
Implement additional endpoints or functionality as needed.
Update the error handling and response messages to align with your project's standards.
